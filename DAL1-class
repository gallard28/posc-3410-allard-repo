# Let's Try Some Basic Arithmetic ####
# Sum of 1 and 1
1+1

# Divide 365 by 12
365/12

# Your turn, multiply 10 by 12
# Your turn, add 28 + 38
28 + 38

# Order of Operations in R
1+1*(365/12)

# Learning to assign variables ####
#Run this line of code to assign your first variable.
myFirstVar<- "Hello world!"

# Run myFirstVar in the console.
myFirstVar

# Code a second variable with a number.
mySecondVar<-16

# Run myFirstVar in the console.
mySecondVar

#Now let's practice assigning variables.
# Assign "Clemson" to `home`
home <- "Clemson"

# Assign "Tigers" to `h_mascot`
h_mascot <- "Tigers"

# Assign "Ohio State" to `away'
away <- "Ohio State"

# Assign 'Buckeyes' to `a_mascot`
a_mascot <- "Buckeyes"

# Assign 31 to ``
homeScore <- 31

# Assign 0 to `awayScore`

# Assign TRUE to homeWin
homeWin<- TRUE

# Assign FALSE to awayWin
